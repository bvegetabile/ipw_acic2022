Introductory Workshop for Using Propensity Score Weights When Drawing Causal Inferences

## Goals

To increase your understanding of:

  * How to define and estimate causal effects
  * How to use propensity scores when estimating causal effects
  * How to assess the validity of key assumptions

To provide step-by-step instructions for using propensity score weights for binary treatment settings
